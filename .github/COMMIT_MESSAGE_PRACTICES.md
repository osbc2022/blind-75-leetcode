## Making a perfect commit message

- The commit message should be structured as follows:
```HTML
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
 > Note : type coudld be `fix`, `feat`, `BREAKING CHANGE` , `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`... etc , and description is what changes you have made (involves body and footer).

 > example `fix : the bug on issue #31` , `feat : added search bar on nav #32` , to know more in detail see resources given below

## Tips :-

- Keep it short (less than 150 characters total)
    - Committing fewer changes at a time can help with this
- Use the imperative mood
    - This convention aligns with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert
    - Consistency enhances speed of reading comprehension
    - Tends to be more concise than the other moods
- Add a title
    - Less than 50 characters
    - Use Title case (i.e. "Add Logging" instead of "add logging")
- Add a body (optional)
    - Less than 100 characters
    - Explain WHAT the change is, but especially WHY the change was needed
    - Leave a blank line between the title and body
    - Separate paragraphs in the body with blank lines
    - Use a hyphen (-) for bullet points if needed
    - Use hanging indents if needed
